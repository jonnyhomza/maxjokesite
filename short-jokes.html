          Slim to Nun?</li>
      <li>My friend recently got crushed by a pile of books. He's only got his shelf to blame.</li>
      <li>An elderly couple was attending a church service. 
            The lady turned towards her husband and said, ‘‘I just let out a really long silent fart. What should I do?’’

            The man smiled and said to her, ‘‘honey, your hearing aid needs a battery replacement.’’	</li>
      <li>I was feeling lonely so I bought some shares. It's nice to have a little company.</li>
      <li>Shhh... what's that smell? It looks like it tastes pointy.</li>
      <li>My friend thinks he's so smart. He told me an onion is the only food that makes
          you cry, so I threw a coconut in his face.</li>
      <li>A guy was driving in a car with a blonde. He told her to stick her head out the window and see if the blinker

      <li>My friend asked me if I like Worcestershire sauce. I said, "I dunno. It's hard to say."</li>
      <li>I saw an ad for a burial plot. I though, "That's the last thing I need."</li>
      <li>A truck loaded with thousands of thesauruses crashed yesterday and lost its entire load. Witnesses were
          stunned, startled, aghast, taken aback, stupefied, confused, shocked, rattled, paralyzed, dazed, bewildered
          surprised, awed, and dumbfounded.</li>
      <li>Wife: "You need to do more chores around the house." <br><br>
          Husband: "Can we change the subject?" <br><br>
          Wife: "OK. More chores around the house need to be done by you."</li>
      <li>Two guys are rowing a boat in the desert. One guy says, "where's your oars." Other guy goes, "yup, sure does."</li>
