      <li>I'm always making Freudian slips. Like this morning, over breakfast with my wife, I meant to say, 
        "Could you please pass the sugar." 
        But instead it came out as, "You heartless cunt, you ruined my life."</li>
      <li>Two ladies were riding their bikes down an unfamiliar road. 
          “I’ve never come this way before,” says the first.
          The second replies, “Must be the cobblestones."</li>
      <li>I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands.</li>
      <li>What do you get when you mix human DNA with goat DNA? Kicked out of the petting zoo.</li>
      <li>Two deer walk out of a gay bar, one turns to the other and says, "I can't believe I blew twenty bucks in there..."</li>
      <li>What’s the German word for bra? Stoppemfromfloppen.</li>
      <li>What do you call a deer with no eyes? No eye-deer.<br><br>
          What do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs? Still no eye-dear.<br><br>
          What do you call a deer with no eyes, no legs, and no penis? Still no fucking eye-dear.</li>
      <li>The chief of the tribe was asked how he chooses his members' names. "I name them after what I see at the time of 
          their birth. If I see snow gently falling, I'll name the baby 'Snow Gently Falling,' 
          if I see a flying hawk, I name the baby 'Flying Hawk.' Now, please tell me, why do ask, Two Dogs Fucking?</li>
      <li>What's the thing about skateboarding? Telling your parents you're gay.</li>
      <li>Guy comes home to his wife with a duck under his arm. He goes, "this is pig I've been telling you about."
          The wife goes, "What do you mean? That's a duck." Guy goes, "I wasn't talking to you."</li>
