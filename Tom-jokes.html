      <li>The squirrels must be expecting a cold winter, they're gathering more nuts this year. Yesterday my uncle disapeared.</li>
      <li>I have a Polish sound man for my band, and a Czech one too.</li>
      <li>Poop jokes aren't my favorite, but they're a solid #2.</li>
      <li>I've been trying to organize a hide-and-seek tournament, but good players are hard to find.</li>
      <li>I met a girl who runs a battery kiosk at the park. 
          She sells C cells by the seesaw.</li>
      <li>Never let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do. 
          Just look at Beethoven, everyone told him he would never be a musician, just 
          because he was deaf. But did he listen?</li>
      <li>I just finished writing a book on penguins. It probably would 
          have been easier to write it on paper.</li>
      <li>Guy takes his 5 year old daughter to work for "take your daughter to work day." He introduces her 
          to everyone and all are welcoming and charming. When he gets to the last of his office workmates,
          his daughter asks, "Is that it?"<br> <br>
          "Yes, Princess, that's all the folks I work with." She begins crying, sobbing, and weeping. 
          "What's wrong, Pumpkin?" he asks. <br><br>
          "You lied to me Daddy, you lied to me!!"<br><br>
          "What do you mean, Honey?"<br><br>
          "The clowns! The clowns! Where are all the clowns you said you worked with everyday?!"</li>
